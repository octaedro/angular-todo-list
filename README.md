## GitHub Actions

Due to the use of Node.js 14, Husky (which requires Node 18+) is not available for local pre-push enforcement.  
To ensure code quality, this project uses a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on every push and pull request.  
Merging into the `main` branch is only allowed if all tests pass.
